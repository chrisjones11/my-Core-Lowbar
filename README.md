# my-Core-Lowbar

Lowbar

Lowbar is my own replica of the JS library "_underscore", in order to understand how a JS library works I'll be reimplementing the functionality of every _underscore function.

Core

These are the core functions I will aim to get finished;

identity
first
last
each
indexOf
filter
reject
uniq
map
contains

Advanced

These are a little harder but will be very beneficial to try and complete.

pluck
reduce
every
some
extends
defaults
