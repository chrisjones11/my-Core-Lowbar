# my-Core-Lowbar

Lowbar

Lowbar is my own replica of the JS library "_underscore", in order to understand how a JS library works I'll be reimplementing the functionality of every _underscore function.

Core

These are the core functions I will aim to get finished;

identity
first
last
each
indexOf
filter
reject
uniq
map
contains
pluck
reduce
every
some
extends
defaults
once
<!-- negate -->
shuffle
invoke
sortBy
zip
<!-- sortedIndex -->
flatten
<!-- difference -->
<!-- memoize -->
<!-- delay -->
<!-- where -->
<!-- throttle -->
<!-- partial -->
